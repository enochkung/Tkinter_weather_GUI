Tkinter_weather_GUI

This is a project following the youtube video "How to Program a GUI Application (with Python Tkinter)!" that creates a GUI that obtains weather information through API of a city of your choice.

I use this project to get the basics of building GUI and API requests and how to turn everything into an exe file.
